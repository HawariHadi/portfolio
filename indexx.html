            <h3>Breast cancer prediction model</h3>
            <p> 
                The Breast Cancer Prediction Model is a crucial project designed to create a sophisticated algorithm capable of forecasting an individual's risk of developing breast cancer and predicting whether the cancer is malignant or benign. This model harnesses advanced machine learning techniques and leverages a comprehensive dataset, including patient demographics, genetic information, and historical health records, to assess the likelihood of breast cancer occurrence and its potential severity. By identifying high-risk individuals and distinguishing between malignant and benign cases, this model offers a powerful tool for early detection, timely intervention, and personalized treatment strategies. It represents a significant advancement in healthcare technology, empowering medical professionals to take proactive measures against one of the most prevalent and potentially life-threatening diseases.

            <h3>A point of sale  </h3>
            <p>In my Point of Sale (POS) project, I developed a Windows Forms application using C#. This system efficiently manages sales transactions, inventory, and product data. It includes user authentication for security and allows authorized users to add, edit, or delete products in the inventory. The core functionality centers around creating sales transactions, calculating totals, and generating receipts for customers. Inventory management keeps track of product quantities, and discounts and promotions can be applied when needed. I utilized a SQL database to store product information and transaction records securely. The system provides essential sales reporting, allowing users to analyze sales data. Overall, this POS project leverages C# and Windows Forms to streamline the sales process and enhance business operations.</p>
